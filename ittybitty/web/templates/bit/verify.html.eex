    <p>This is the key to your bit. It has been initialized to the value <i class="pre">0</i>.</p>
    <code>
    <%= @key %>
    </code>
    <p>You can read your bit with a GET request to <i class="pre">/api/bit/<%= @key %></i>, and update its value with a PUT request and a value parameter <i class="pre">/api/bit/<%= @key %>?value=1</i>.</p>
    <p>Please note there is <b>no security</b> around updating this bit, so please keep the value secret if that is important to your usage. If accounts/locking/access control are things that you would like to see, please let me know. Contact info is over at the <a href="/about">about</a> page.</p>
    <p>For more details on how to use your bit, please review the <a href="/documentation">documentation</a>.</p>
